# Middlebury Library Content Guide
This guide is for Middlebury library employees to help standardize the language used when writing about the library. When engaging in work that will be read by the public, please refer to the guide and follow recommendations.

# Understanding Library Users
## User Personas
The library’s user base at the college is diverse. We have students, whose information literacy skills range from the most basic to very advanced. We also serve faculty, staff, and the surrounding community. Because of this diversity and spectrum of abilities, we need to be quite flexible in our approaches - with help available for less experienced users and advanced tools and shortcuts available for power users. In cases where we have made a design/navigation decision that favored one user group over another, we tried to favor students. Our reasoning here is that faculty have more experience with library resources and therefore are more likely to persist until they find what they need.

Jordan is a new student at Middlebury, she hasn’t decided her major yet, but is interested in Anthropology or Psychology. She has written some research papers in high school, but is not entirely sure how to format and cite a paper. Jordan has a work study in the library and is confident helping other students with basic library tasks.
In the fall, she had a library instruction session where she learned how to use the library and to access online materials. Even though she is familiar with library resources, Jordan still prefers using Google Scholar, though isn't always able to access relevant books and articles. When she is unable to find what she’s looking for, she may use Summon as a backup.
